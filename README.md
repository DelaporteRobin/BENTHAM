# BENTHAM
> Your personnal and automated Linkedin Scrapper
> So you don't have to scroll anymore :)

Believe it or not, I'm not the biggest fan of LinkedIn, and I've always found that scouring your feed to find recruitment posts that are relevant to you is a potentially time-consuming task.
By indicating your specialties and those you are not proficient in, Bentham will automatically find the recruitment posts that are relevant to you in your feed every day.

You can even set it up as an automatic Windows task that launches when you start your computer.
